                Because of they lack of sexual difference most people think that females are rare but in reality gemtars do not have gender but do need a mate to reproduce like most gendered animals. Even though the sex put on a gemtar is only made my the people around it. It does effect the body of the gemtar as it molds itself into a more permanent form. The final form of a gemtar can still be molded but as it is painful not many do it willingly. The quartz composite they are made of is like the meat of a more organic animal. Gemtars don't eat organic food they eat mostly sand specifically silica sand otherwise known as white sand. They can eat other rocks and dirt but they mostly need the quartz in the sand to live. Gemtars do need a mate but sex as shown in other animals Is not how it is done as they reproduce by magic and carve their child.

                Gemtars are mostly slaves and farmed for their gem hearts. Known for being peaceful people they were in slave easily. Some gemtars are forced to have human sexual organs by a painful and inhumane molding process. These gemtars are used as sex slave most of the time. Even in some places gemtars would paint themselves a human skin color to better blend into human cities. Even though gemtars have been enslaved by humans. Elves, dwarves, and even orcs have seen gemtars and been peaceful with them and even help them leave human civilizations. For elves and dwarves specifically they have joined communities and even mixed into the population making what humans call sand elves and bedrock dwarves respectfully. Gemtars have been seen being made of limestone, basalt, and obsidian these are rare as they don't live long.
